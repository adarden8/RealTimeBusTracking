# Real-Time Bus Tracker Project
## Week 9 Assignment: MITxPro Full Stack Development with MERN

### Description
The objective of this project was to track the current location of busses in Boston, MA, specifically those that were between MIT and Harvard. Mapbox was used as the mapping platform and live GPS information was accesses through MBTA API. 

### How To Run
This project can be forked and downloaded or run at adarden8.github.io/RealTimeBusTracking/.

### Future Improvements
Possible improvements could include: adding different markers to show bus occupancy, increasing the route to include the entire Route 1 and not just the area between MIT and Harvard, and changing the markers from being "on-click" events to "hover".
